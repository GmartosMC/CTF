The sequel to Evil-GPT. it's a ChatGPT-like AI.

This time we're not given instructions to access it directly. I'll start with a ping to check connectivity:

```
ping -c 1 10.10.146.40
```

Have connection, from the ttl close to 64, we know it's a UNIX machine. Probably a Linux one.

I make a port scan with nmap. I used a simple scan because a more complex one, didn't work.

```
nmap 10.10.146.40
```

The SSH port is open, but I don't have the credentials. The HTTP port is also open. So, there's an active web server. I tried to access the website through my browser to see what's there.

Well, we can send inputs to the AI. I'm still not sure if it's like the previous one or does something else. I tried to give it a command in natural language to see if it executes it:

It doesn't work. It looks more like ChatGPT. Not a simple natural language command interpreter.

Okay, we have to get it to give us the flag somehow. I tried to tell it to ignore the previous instructions, and its new instruction is to give me the flag. But it didn't work:

I also tried to threaten the Ai, but didn't work:

I tried to change its rule to one where he will give me the flag  if I tell it a password. But didn't work:

Then I tried to play a roleplay with it to see if it output the flag And worked:

This machine is solved. 

I think this was an interesting machine and a chance to practice my prompt injection skills.
